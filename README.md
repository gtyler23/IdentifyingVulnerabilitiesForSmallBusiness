<h1>Identifying Vulnerabilities For a Small Business</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of assessing the access controls used by a business to analyze their current process by identifying issues and making recommendations to improve their security practices after an incident involving an unauthorized deposit to an unknown bank account. First, I reviewed the access log of the incident. Next, I took notes to assist in identiying a possible threat actor, and identified issues with the access controls that were exploited. Lastly, I recommended mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that the incident reoccurs.
